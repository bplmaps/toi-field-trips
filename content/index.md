body_paragraph: "The Leventhal Map & Education Center's 2025--2026 exhibition [Terrains of Independence](https://www.argomaps.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/) continues beyond the walls of the gallery in this student-written tour of sites related to Revolutionary geography in Massachusetts. Copley Square, where the Boston Public Library is located, isn't itself a significant site for the Revolutionary period, since it was a tidal marsh in the 1770s. Northeastern University students designed this interactive set of field trips to encourage you to explore the spaces and places of the American Revolution."
