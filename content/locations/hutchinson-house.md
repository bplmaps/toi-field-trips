# The Hutchinson House #

## The Hutchinson Family ## 

The Hutchinson family was one of the most prominent New England families in history. The first member of the family to arrive in the New World was the famed Anne Hutchinson. Anne moved to Boston in 1633, just three years after the city’s founding, but was exiled in 1638 due to disagreements between her and the leading Puritans. She has gone down in history as one of the most influential women in colonial history. Even though she did not live in Boston again after her exile, her son Edward returned to the city. The Hutchinsons were very prominent in the military, political, and economic spheres, as its members served in the colonial legislature, as merchants, and as soldiers. By the time of the American Revolution, the house was occupied by Thomas Hutchinson, who served on the governor’s council, chief justice of Massachusetts Bay, the lieutenant governor, was acting governor several times, and was officially promoted to governor in 1771.

## The House Itself ##

Although relatively little is known about the Hutchinson House’s construction story, what is known is that it was built around 1687 by Thomas’s grandfather Colonel John Foster. It was located in the North End on Garden Court Street (please interact with the map below to see exactly where). It was a large three-story, red brick house that dwarfed the other homes around it. There are existing floor plans of the manor, but it has been described by several people who had been in it. The first floor contained a parlor for entertaining visitors and a hall, which served as a family common area akin to a living room or den. Thomas’s bedroom and the guest bedroom were on the second floor, and the third floor was most likely where his sons slept. 

Due to colonial documents that will be discussed later, we know much more about the manor’s contents than we do the layout. Many of the rooms contained walnut furniture, and the guest bedroom even contained furniture made from ivory. Hutchinson owned silver-hilted swords, paintings with golden frames, chairs lined with Moroccan leather, satin sheets and cushions, and numerous “japanned” pieces of furniture, which are items designed and constructed to look like they were from East Asia. The Hutchinson Family Manor was one of the largest and most opulent homes in all of Boston and served as a symbol of the Hutchinson family’s success.

## The Final Straw ##

In the mid eighteenth century while Thomas Hutchinson was climbing his way up the political ladder, Boston was becoming a city full of people who were angry with the British government. In 1747, Bostonians rioted for days in response to men in the city being forced in the British Navy against their will. These riots lasted for three days, during which rioters threw stones at the windows of the Old State House. The Sugar Act of 1764, which was a tax on sugar and molasses, led to widespread protest from the colonists as well. Although there was no widespread violence, many colonists boycotted British businesses and spoke out against the law. The situation was made worse with the passing of the Stamp Act in 1765. The Stamp Act was a tax on all paper in the colonies, which included everything from newspapers to playing cards, faced widespread outrage amongst the colonists due to how it affected all social and economic classes. Not only were the colonists mad at Parliament in London for passing the Act, but they were also angry at many of the colonial officials in Boston. They felt that many of the officials benefitted from these laws and/or that they had refused to help the colonists due to not wanting to lose any prestige with people in London. Thus, the Bostonians decided to express their outrage by destroying several stamp offices where the tax was enforced and by destroying colonial officials’ houses and belongings. 

## The Hutchinson House is Ransacked ##

On the night of August 26, 1765, an angry mob of colonists marched to the Hutchinson House (Thomas was lieutenant governor at the time). They were angry that Hutchinson would not formally renounce the Stamp Act to London and that his brother-in-law had recently been promoted to stamp officer for the city. Hutchinson actually did have problems with the Stamp Act and had told people in London so, but never publicly agreed to not enforce it. Whatever the case, Thomas and his family were told while eating dinner that a mob was coming to destroy his house. His family fled in their evening close to another house south of Boston, and shortly after their departure, the mob arrived. The mob removed all of the possessions from the manor and threw them into the street. The items that were not destroyed were stolen, although a few items were eventually returned. Even many of the interior walls were destroyed as well. When Thomas Hutchinson returned to the manor the next day, he said all that was left were the walls and floors. He then went to what is now the Old State House to ask for compensation for his destroyed belongings. It is actually from his report for compensation that we know what he owned and how much it was worth. The rioters destroyed so much of his belongings that when Thomas went before the colonial government, he was wearing his night clothes, because they were the only thing left. According to the report, the damages done were worth around $545,000 in today’s money. 



## The Legacy of the Hutchinson Riot ##

Even though not many people from outside of Boston know about the destruction of the Hutchinson house, it was an important catalyst for the American Revolution. The ransacking of the Hutchinson Manor was one of the main reasons that then governor, Francis Bernard, called for British soldiers to bring order to the city. A year and a half after their arrival, these soldiers would commit the Boston Massacre, which is believed by many to be the beginning of the end of British rule in colonial America. Eventually, the Hutchinson House was removed, and the only thing that marks its location is an easy to miss plaque. Unfortunately, the plaque makes no mention of the looting of the manor, but this event and building must not be forgotten. The Hutchinson House was one of the most opulent buildings in the city and was built by one of the oldest Boston families, a family which had numerous ties to England, but within a short time, it was destroyed by Patriots in the years leading to the Revolution. Its site is now mostly forgotten while the nearby Paul Revere House still stands. It serves as a fitting example of the rapid and complete change America went through before, during, and after the War of Independence.
