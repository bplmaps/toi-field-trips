# A Street of Transformation 

Merchant’s Row was once a bustling commercial hub at the heart of Boston, pivotal to the city's growth as a major port in the 18th and 19th centuries. Positioned near the waterfront, this street and the connections forged on it helped establish Boston as a key player in international trade. Today, though much of the street has been redeveloped, its historical significance endures in the surrounding Financial District, a thriving area of commerce. 

### Location and Urban Context 

Strategically developed near Boston’s waterfront, Merchant’s Row was a waterside street crucial in trade networks for the importation and exportation of goods. It was close to landmarks like the Old State House, Custom House, and Faneuil Hall, and became the center for Boston’s merchant class. The city’s narrow, winding streets were shaped by the geography of the Shawmut Peninsula, and its natural deep-water harbors created opportunities for maximizing trade ventures, making Boston’s merchant row an ideal location for maritime commerce. 

Additionally, according to the historian Benjamin L. Carp, 
>News passed through this gateway along with goods and travelers. Seaborne newspapers and letters transmitted information from one port to another, although not all news appeared in print. The waterfront sustained other vital networks of communications: the taverns where people read newspapers and exchanged ideas, the transient population of mariners who carried news and gossip by ship, and the interpersonal trading connections that linked the Atlantic seaports.

By the 18th century, Boston’s waterfront had become one of the busiest ports in the Americas. Merchant’s Row, with its warehouses and offices, was integral to the city’s booming trade network. The largest and most prominent building which exited during revolutionary times was the Triangular Warehouse, which was speculated to have been owned by Dutch Tea Traders, since that is where most of the tea from holland had been smuggled into.

### The Role of Merchant’s Row in Boston’s Economy 

As a vital node in the transatlantic trading network, the wealthy merchants like James Bowdoin and profiteering smugglers like John Hancock and John Roe who worked on this street controlled the import and export of goods like molasses, sugar, rum, textiles, and tea. These goods were exchanged across the Atlantic and the Caribbean, connecting Boston to Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean islands. 

A key component of this trade was the triangular, transatlantic trade system: enslaved Africans were brought to the Americas and the Caribbean, from these locales, raw materials like sugar and molasses were shipped to Great Britain, and manufactured goods like textiles and rum from the British Empire were then sent to West Africa in exchange for more enslaved people. Merchant’s Row was central to this exchange.

### Slavery in Colonial Boston 

Slavery was integral to Boston’s economy. As an important port in the transatlantic slave trade, Boston’s wealth was partly built on the forced labor of enslaved Africans.

Enslaved people worked in Boston’s harbor, on ships, in warehouses, and in the homes of wealthy merchants. The wealth generated from this exploitation of human labor was vital to Boston’s mercantile economy. Despite its reputation for revolutionary ideals, Boston’s practice of slavery is a fact often overshadowed by the city’s role in the fight for independence.

### Phillis Wheatley

Phillis Wheatley was an African American poet, born around 1753 near the coast of West Africa, who was enslaved and brought to Boston at a young age. She would have likely been purchased by the Wheatley family in Merchant's Row and lived very close by. She became the first African American woman to publish a book of poetry, *Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral*, in 1773. Her work, praised for its classical style and intellectual depth, played a significant role in challenging racial stereotypes during the 18th century. She became so famous in her brief lifetime that she traded letters of correspondence with George Washington. 

### Merchant’s Row and the American Revolution

Merchant’s Row was crucial to the events leading up to the American Revolution. The merchant class, heavily impacted by British policies like the Stamp Act (1765) and the Townshend Acts (1767), organized boycotts of British goods, often planning them in commercial hubs like Merchant’s Row and Faneuil Hall. Boston’s economy, which was primarily based on sea trade, depended heavily on its merchants' access to both regional and international markets. However, the city’s hinterland had few industries to support its economy, making it particularly vulnerable to external trade disruptions. As British policies became more coercive and punitive, the local economy suffered greatly. These economic constraints led to widespread hardship, prompting even greater resistance from Boston’s merchant class. (Earle, p.153-172)

For their part, the merchants, more literate and educated than most in a well read society, adopted the ideas of enlightenment Europe and used them to influence the poor working class. By extolling the virtues of freedoms, like political representation, privacy, and self-regulation, the rich class of merchants managed to convince impoverished people that they were being oppressed by the British parliament, and that their rights as Englishmen were getting taken away. Through this rabble rousing, the rich American colonists managed to incite chaos and rebellion with the aim of cutting their ties with the British so that they could make more money after the war. (Schiff, p. 143-171)

The most famous event tied to this resistance was the Boston Tea Party of 1773. When the British East India Company bypassed colonial merchants by directly shipping tea to the colonies, it sparked a dramatic protest. Members of the Sons of Liberty, including Samuel Adams, dumped 342 chests of British tea into Boston Harbor, an act symbolizing defiance against both British trade restrictions and punitive economic measures.

The historian Samuel Eliot Morison described the response from the British, writing that 
>The importance of maritime commerce in the history of Boston and of New England can hardly be overestimated. Until the industrial revolution of the 19th century, Boston lived and thrived by making good use of her access to the sea. The attempt of Parliament, in 1774, to exclude Boston altogether from the element that made her great, was a punishment comparable to the destruction of Carthage.

### The Legacy of Merchant’s Row in Modern Boston 

Today, the legacy of Merchant’s Row lives on in the surrounding Financial District. The land reclamations of Boston that doubled the size of the city have removed any trace of this location, and today a side street is named after what used to exist here. Yet, while the street itself no longer exists, landmarks like the Old State House, Faneuil Hall, and the Custom House continue to serve as reminders of the city’s mercantile past. 

Merchant’s Row’s legacy is tied not only to its physical structures but also to the pivotal role it played in Boston’s economic growth and the political revolution that helped shape the nation.
