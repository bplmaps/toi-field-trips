What were children in Boston doing in the years leading up to the American Revolution? The answer is that many of them were attending school. This seems self-explanatory, but schools were vital in exposing children to the revolutionary ideology that supplemented the Revolutionary War. In this context, it seems especially fitting that Boston is considered the “cradle of liberty.”

Historian J. L. Bell states that children in Boston learned concepts such as liberty, tyranny, and patriotism in the years leading up to the Revolution. With the addition of loyalty, these four concepts comprise the revolutionary ideology discussed in this essay. 

# Education in Boston
[Education in Boston](https://www.paulreverehouse.org/an-introduction-to-education-in-early-massachusetts/) came in many forms, with public schools, private education, and the apprentice system being the most common forms of education. Private education began in the home at a young age and was the beginning of all children’s education. At the age of seven, some children departed from private education and began public school or took on an apprenticeship. However, most girls and Boston’s upper class continued to receive private education for reasons such as societal gender expectations for girls and education quality concerns for Boston’s upper class. 

## Apprenticeships
Boston hosted an extensive [apprenticeship system](https://www.oldnorth.com/blog/the-mechanicks-of-boston/) that was an alternative to more traditional forms of education. Children would learn the ins and outs of their chosen trade, such as printing or shoemaking, under the care of their mentor until their twenty-first birthday, when they would complete their apprenticeship. Apprenticeships were often sought after by lower class, often immigrant, children who couldn’t afford to attend school for financial reasons. Both girls and boys participated in the apprenticeship system, however, boys were the predominant participants. About half of Boston’s school-aged boys took on an apprenticeship instead of attending school.

## Girls’ Education
Girls did not attend public school in Boston until after the American Revolution, but rather received the majority of their [education](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/remembering-ladies#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20community%20schools,and%20less%20frequently%20than%20boys.) via in-home private schooling. This is because girls weren’t thought to need the same level of education as boys since they would be staying in the home rather than pursuing a public career in their adult life. As such, they did not need the same education that boys received. Girls typically learned handwriting, needlework, and other domestic skills that prepared them for domestic life. Girls from upper-class families received more extensive education than girls from lower-class families, who were more likely to participate in the apprenticeship system.

However, girls were still exposed to revolutionary ideology during their education even though they were privately educated. Yarn spinning contests, also known as [spinning bees](https://wams.nyhistory.org/settler-colonialism-and-revolution/the-american-revolution/spinning-wheels-spinning-bees/), demonstrate this. These contests supported local manufacturers and were a form of protest against British imports. Through these competitions, girls were taught to associate American patriotism with their textile work, a skill taught as part of their private education. So by continuing their education, girls reinforced the association between female crafts and American patriotism.

## Public Schools
In the pre-Revolutionary era, there were five [public schools](https://www.paulreverehouse.org/an-introduction-to-education-in-early-massachusetts/) in Boston. Three of the schools were writing schools and two were grammar schools. The three writing schools were the North Writing School, the South Writing School, and the Queen Street Writing School. Writing schools taught boys the basics, such as reading, writing, and math. Boys would enter writing school at age seven and finish at age thirteen. After completing writing school, boys would decide to either continue their education at one of Boston’s grammar schools or enter an apprenticeship. Grammar schools taught boys more advanced topics, such as Latin, Greek, and classical literature, and were considered preparatory schools for Harvard. The two grammar schools were the North Grammar School and the South Grammar School, which is the Boston Latin School today. Admittance to both writing and grammar schools in this period was limited to white boys.

While all five schools helped educate Boston’s young men in the pre-Revolutionary era, this essay discusses in detail the [Boston Latin School](https://www.bls.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=206116&type=d). This is because when compared to the other four schools, the Boston Latin School has the most detailed historical records available today. These detailed records exist due to the school’s long history and prestige as the oldest school in America. However, this focus on the Boston Latin School does not mean the other schools did not play a role in exposing Boston’s young men to revolutionary ideology. All five schools working together were vital in spreading revolutionary ideology to all of Boston’s school-aged boys. Just because good historical records exist for one of the schools does not mean the contributions of the other four schools will be overlooked.

## Boston Latin School
The [Boston Latin School](https://www.bls.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=206116&type=d) was established on April 23, 1635, by the town of Boston and is the oldest school in the United States. Depicted above is an illustration of what the school looked like in the pre-Revolutionary era. Many Revolutionary War heroes attended the Boston Latin School, including Benjamin Franklin and Samuel Adams. However, the Boston Latin School contributed to the Revolutionary War in ways beyond producing war heroes. The school introduced revolutionary ideology to boys.

One way the Boston Latin School exposed revolutionary ideology to its students was via the teacher. The master of the school, John Lovell, was a loyalist, however, the usher, his son [James Lovell](https://www.bls.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=206116&type=d), was an ardent patriot. James Lovell gave one of the first speeches about the Boston Massacre in the Old South Meeting House, and in June 1775 was arrested for his political beliefs. Being such an ardent patriot, it can be assumed James Lovell communicated his beliefs to his students. Supporting the claim that Lovell exposed his students to revolutionary ideology is the fact that he closed the school on April 19, 1775, the day of the Battle of Lexington and Concord, with the statement:

>“War's begun and school's done; deponite libros.”

“Deponite libros” translates to “put the books down” and is the phrase teachers would use to end the school day. 

The revolutionary ideology introduced to the students by James Lovell did not deviate drastically from what the boys were already learning. Depicted below at the bottom of the image is a [catalog](https://archive.org/details/catalogueofbosto00bostuoft/page/n53/mode/2up) of the Boston Latin School’s classes around the time of the pre-Revolutionary era. The students were being taught classical literature and history, which would have included enlightenment themes such as liberty, which is one of the main ideologies of the Revolutionary War. James Lovell was simply taking the theories he was teaching and applying them to the colonists' struggle against the British.

# Solidifying Revolutionary Ideology
The revolutionary ideology that boys learned in school was solidified by the Revolutionary War events they witnessed. By witnessing such events, boys were able to see how the theoretical translated to the practical, which demonstrated the ways that the revolutionary ideologies they were learning could be put into practice.

Discussed below are two events that took place in Boston before the Revolutionary War, but are considered preliminary war events. Children were confirmed to have been present for both of the events below. Additionally, the timing of the events means that boys could have witnessed the events either going to or from school, creating a further connection between what they were learning at school and what they were witnessing.

## Stamp Act Riots
The [first Stamp Act riot](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/boston-liberty-tree) took place on August 14, 1765, on the corner of Essex and Newbury Street, which is modern-day Washington Street. A crowd of Bostonians hung two effigies, one of Andrew Oliver, the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, and one meant to represent two members of the Grenville ministry, the ones responsible for creating the Stamp Act. The hanging was meant to protest the implementation of the Stamp Act, which put in place a tax on paper in the colonies. The tree that the effigies were hung on became known as the Liberty Tree, which is depicted above.

Students of the South Writing School likely witnessed the riot on their morning route to school. The corner of Essex and Newbury Street is one block away from the South Writing School, which places the locations in close proximity to one another. Additionally, the riot took place on the morning of August 14, meaning students could have seen it before school started for the day.

## Boston Massacre
The [Boston Massacre](https://www.masshist.org/revolution/massacre.php) took place on March 5, 1770, and was a confrontation between British soldiers and colonists. A soldier, after being harassed by a group of children, fired on the group. The violence escalated and resulted in the death of five colonists. The massacre was a culmination of rising tensions between the two groups.

Once again the proximity and the time of day mean it was likely that students witnessed the event. However, in this instance, it was most likely students of the Boston Latin School who witnessed the event. The Boston Massacre took place on King Street, which is roughly a block away from the Boston Latin School. Additionally, it was late afternoon when the event took place, potentially late enough that students could have witnessed it on their route home from school. 

# Putting the Revolutionary Ideology into Practice
After boys learned revolutionary ideology in school and had it solidified by witnessing revolutionary events, they put into practice the revolutionary ideology themselves. 

## Thursday Afternoon Protests
On Thursdays, the schools closed early so that students could attend talks hosted by the town of Boston. However, instead of attending the talks, in 1770, schoolboys started picketing known importers’ shops. These demonstrations were organized and enacted by the students themselves, and students from all the Boston schools participated. 

On February 22, 1770, students were picketing in the North End when [Ebenezer Richardson](https://www.masshist.org/database/viewer.php?item_id=318&pid=2), a customs officer, attempted to stop them. The boys refused and followed Richardson back to his house where they began a riot. In an attempt to dispel the students, Richardson fired into the crowd, killing two boys. One of the casualties was Christopher Seider, who was said to have been coming from school when he joined in on the riot. It’s unknown which school he attended. His death is considered the first official death of the Revolutionary War. While this event is tragic, it demonstrates the boys’ commitment to the revolutionary cause and ideology. 

## Assisting Boston’s Militia
For two weeks in September 1774, the students of the South Writing School hid two of the [Boston militia’s cannons](https://www.oldconcorddar.org/four-brass-cannons.html) inside of the school. The cannons were successfully hidden, with none of the boys revealing the location. This demonstrates that the boys understood the revolutionary concepts of loyalty and patriotism, They supported the militia’s efforts in resisting the British forces by hiding military supplies in a location that the British would not have thought to look.

# Conclusion
Schools were vital in educating children on the revolutionary ideologies that were the driving force behind the American Revolution. However, Boston’s schools were unique. This is because Boston fostered the beginning of the Revolution, and as such, hosted countless moments where revolutionary ideology was put into practice. With Boston being a hub of revolutionary activity, children were able to not only learn about the revolutionary ideology, they were able to see and also practice it themselves. This revolutionary education helped shape the future of the United States, as the children were the ones who grew up and continued to put into practice the revolutionary ideology they learned in their youth.
