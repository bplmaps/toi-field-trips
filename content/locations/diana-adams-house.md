# Introduction
As revolutionary thoughts and ideologies grew in Boston as the end of the 18th century neared, these revolutionary ideals grew beyond the American economy and politics into the [domestic sphere](https://ejournals.bc.edu/index.php/elements/article/view/8906). Democracy, equality, and independence as beliefs started to find their way into the social order of women. [Republican motherhood](https://uncpress.org/book/9780807846322/women-of-the-republic/) enabled women to be educators of the next generation of great American citizens, while other women found independence through owning businesses and property. Women's lives changed as they reached beyond the traditional domestic space.

## Women in 18th Century Boston
Women in the 18th century were often traditionally regarded in relation to their husbands and the men in their families. The influence of these women depended on the wealth and power that their families possessed within Boston's social, economic, and political spheres. American painter [John Singleton Copley](https://www.nga.gov/collection/artist-info.1162.html#biography) worked in Boston until 1774, leaving to continue his studies and career in Europe. While in Boston, Copley established himself as a portrait painter for the elites within the upper and merchant classes of Boston. Copley's portraits of Boston women offer a glimpse into the values of the white upper class as the revolutionary era began.

John Singleton Copley, *Ezekiel Goldthwait*, 1771, oil on canvas, Boston, Museum of Fine Arts. 

Copley painted [Ezekiel Goldthwait](https://collections.mfa.org/objects/32757/ezekiel-goldthwait?ctx=bd9b771e-e8cb-49e3-be0c-00821a067539&idx=1) along with his wife Elizabeth in a pair of portraits. Paired portraiture was commissioned by men like Ezekiel Goldthwait to display their power, superiority, and status. Paired portraits of married couples also enforced the idea that women belonged to their husbands. A husband's portrait typically would command a sense of authority over the viewer, while a wife's portrait depicted her next to him as an obedient and unassuming individual within their home. 

Mrs. Ezekiel Goldthwait appears here in front of a dark and anonymous setting, removing her from any environment of influence, while her husband appears at his desk working. Elizabeth conveys no authoritative presence as she sits at a table, most likely within her home. The bowl of fruit on the table that she reaches for may symbolize the Goldthwait wealth and Elizabeth's own fertility, as she gave birth to thirteen children throughout her marriage to Ezekiel. The portrait of Mrs. Ezekial Goldthwait is representative of other women in 18th-century Boston whose existence remained obscured behind their husbands and the traditional patriarchal values of the colonial era. 

### Elizabeth Murray

During this era, some women chose not to be limited to a life only within the home and remain dependent on a husband. Finding success in running a business, like importing and selling goods, was a path out of the domestic sphere for some colonial women like [Elizabeth Murray](https://www.bwht.org/explore/elizabeth-murray/). Murray was married three times but had no children. She ran a business importing fabric, millinery items, and other dry goods from Britain and sold them in Boston, near the State House. 

As a woman with independent wealth from her husband, Elizabeth Murray commissioned Copley to paint her portrait. She stands alone in the painting and there is no accompanying portrait of her husband, emphasizing her independent lifestyle outside of the home. Murray is posed standing and looking at the viewer, demonstrating her ability to command power through her success as a woman business owner. The outdoor scene behind her contrasts the blank background in Mrs. Ezekiel Goldthwait's portrait. Murray's outdoor background scene symbolizes her role outside of the home that Mrs. Ezekiel Goldthwait may have been confined within. Similar to the Goldthwait portrait, Murray is holding fruit in her hands against her body. Instead of symbolizing the colonial women's virtue of fertility, the fruit in Murray's portrait possibly represents the wealth she successfully created for herself through her importing and selling of goods.  

## Diana Adams

A way for women to gain independence outside of owning a business was to own property. Women property owners in the 18th century could have inherited their property from a male family member or their late husband, if they did not have access to their own wealth like Elizabeth Murray did as a merchant. Diana Adams appears in [Clough's Atlas of Boston neighborhoods](https://www.masshist.org/database/1761) as owning properties on Prince Street next to the Charles River. She also appears in Boston's city directories in 1798 and 1800 as living on Prince Street.  Diana does not appear in the 1803 city directory as the city's [probate record](https://www.americanancestors.org/DB2735/i/48702/21842-co2/73277256) of her estate listed her death in 1803.

John West's 1798 Boston City Directory.

In an earlier directory from [1796](https://archive.org/details/bd-1796/page/n13/mode/2up), Thomas Adams was listed as living on Prince Street. Thomas and Diana appear together in a list of [Boston birth records](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F4DK-S2V) from 1775 as the parents of Diana Adams. Their daughter Diana married [Edward Staples](https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QG1K-NTTV) in 1791. Edward Staples was named the administrator of Diana's estate after her death in 1803, as her estate would have passed on to her children. Diana would have occupied a similar domestic space and social order as Mrs. Ezekiel Goldthwait, living with her merchant husband in the North End. Diana would have lived independently for several years following her husband Thomas's death in 1796. She may have relied on her daughter and son-in-law for some support, but she was the owner of the property on Prince Street, which was a freedom not granted to many colonial women.
